The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find how I explored the 2017 marathon results dataset, focusing on key attributes like age, gender, and nationality to uncover patterns in finishing times. The analysis begins by examining the demographic distribution of the participants, including the number of finishers by gender and country. Visualizations such as pie charts and bar plots highlight these distributions, revealing interesting demographic insights.

Subsequently, the project delves into the relationship between finishing times and participants' attributes. The project further illustrates these relationships through scatter plots demonstrating how finishing times change with age and differ between genders.

The findings provide valuable insights for athletes and organizers alike, from understanding performance trends across different age groups to planning more efficient marathon events. These analyses not only enhance our understanding of marathon dynamics but also support better decision-making for future races.


**Age Distribution based on Gender in the Marathon:**

The boxplot depicted above offers a comprehensive visualization of the distribution of finishersâ€™ ages stratified by gender in the marathon event. Each boxplot represents the age distribution for a specific gender category, with the median age marked by a horizontal line inside the box. By employing a fill color corresponding to gender (blue for males and pink for females), the plot effectively distinguishes between the two groups. This boxplot provides valuable insights into the age distributions for male and female finishers, facilitating comparisons and uncovering potential differences or similarities in age demographics based on gender identity.


## Project 02

In this project, I explored further in the 2017 marathon results, providing insights into various factors influencing race performance. Utilizing the marathon_results_2017.csv dataset, the analysis begins with a detailed exploration of the dataset's structure, dimensions, and summary statistics. Key visualizations include an interactive histogram showcasing the distribution of finish times and a geographic map displaying participant origins by country.

A critical aspect of the study is the examination of how age and gender impact marathon performance. A linear regression model is employed to predict finishing times based on these attributes. The analysis reveals significant trends: finishing times generally increase with age, and male participants, on average, have faster finishing times than females. The findings are visualized through scatter plots and model coefficient plots, which highlight the estimated effects of age and gender on race performance.

This project not only uncovers patterns within the 2017 marathon data but also provides valuable tools for future race planning and personal performance benchmarking. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

**Marathon Participants by Country:**

The above visualization shows a world map indicating the number of marathon participants by country. The map uses a gradient color scale from light green to orange to represent participant numbers, with green indicating lower participation and orange indicating higher participation. The United States stands out with the highest participation, reflected by the deep orange shade, indicating around 20,000 participants. Several countries in Europe, Asia, and South America are shaded in lighter green, showing moderate levels of participation. In contrast, many countries in Africa, Central Asia, and parts of South America are light gray, indicating no data or negligible participation. The color gradient bar at the bottom of the map provides a reference for the participant numbers corresponding to the color intensity.


## Project 03

In this project, I explored creating density plots and exploring the distribution of continuous variables, specifically utilizing weather data from Tampa International Airport for 2022, where the focus is to replicate and analyze different charts to understand temperature variations and precipitation patterns throughout the year. Additionally, the project dives into analyzing concrete compressive strength data, focusing on the relationship between strength and factors like age, cement content, and water content. By using data visualization techniques such as density plots, box plots, and scatter plots, the analysis provides insights into the factors affecting concrete strength and highlights patterns and trends in weather data.

**Exploring Strength versus (Cement, Age, and Water):**

The above visualization shows the scatter plot which indicates that at higher levels, as cement content increases, so does strength. Most of the purple dots are at the top, indicating that optimal water content results in higher compressive strength. Smaller dots tend to be at the bottom, suggesting that lower age correlates with lower strength. However, these trends are not entirely consistent.


### Moving Forward

This course offered a comprehensive exploration of data visualization techniques and their powerful role in data storytelling. Throughout the process, I learned how to effectively transform raw data into meaningful visual representations that facilitate deeper understanding and insights.

Looking ahead, I am eager to delve further into advanced data visualization techniques and storytelling approaches. My goal is to master creating dynamic and interactive visualizations that can engage audiences and convey complex information effortlessly. This course has laid a strong foundation, and I am excited to build upon it in future projects and endeavors.
